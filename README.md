# lager - blocking + un-threaded version

⚠ Construction Ahead ⚠

Everything about my code and its underlying concepts is questionable, fantastical, and fragile-at-best right-down to its core premises of 'beating' the Halting Problem, novel intelligences, establishing co-learning pedogeological architectures, knowledgebases, and 'Morphological source code' and its 'kernel agents'.

A necessary foundation for the frail and fraught code I intend to erect on top of it. Exercise in modularizing my python so that its turnkey and (python) portable.

I wrote this instead of reading some preposterously long license legalese. I had chosen a random new one because I'm just impulsive like that:

```
MIT code, concise and dear,
Why seek long tomes, dense and unclear?
Read it, trust it, free to share.
```
